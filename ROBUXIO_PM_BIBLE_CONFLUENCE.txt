h2. Why This Version Exists

*What We Learned the Hard Way:*

|| Problem || What Happened || Cost ||
| *6 weeks → 3 days* | Work started without being startable | Factsheet disaster, trust lost |
| *Silence = Approval* | People assumed no reply meant yes | Wrong work built |
| *CTO as Safety Net* | Devs waited for Deneb instead of solving | Single point of failure |
| *PM as Coordinator* | Hakan tracked status but didn't drive outcomes | Process existed but didn't work |
| *Part-time Reality Ignored* | Framework assumed full-time commitment | Ceremonies couldn't happen |

{info:title=This Bible merges hard lessons with Azara's pragmatic approach.}{info}

----

h2. Current Team Structure

h3. Interim PM: Javier Azara

|| Attribute || Reality ||
| *Role* | PM-Light + Active Developer |
| *Time* | ~16 hours/month PM duties + development work |
| *Authority* | Can block unclear work, cannot hire/fire |
| *Limitation* | Cannot attend all meetings, must prioritize |

{warning:title=Conflict of Interest Acknowledgment}
Azara is both a developer AND the PM. When his own tickets need review, CTO (Deneb) acts as process enforcer.
{warning}

----

h3. The Robuxio Team

|| Role || Person || Responsibility || Approves ||
| *CEO* | Pavel | Business priority, strategic decisions | Strategic items |
| *COO* | Dries | Client-facing tools, business context | Client/UX correctness |
| *CTO* | Deneb | Technical architecture, feasibility | All tickets (technical) |
| *Quant* | Olda | Trading logic, financial correctness | Trading tickets |
| *PM-Light* | Azara | Flow, clarity, process enforcement | Nothing (enforces process) |
| *Developers* | Deneb, Leonardo, Jamolpe, Erro, Azara | Delivery | Nothing (execute) |

h1. Part 1: The 10 Non-Negotiable Rules

{panel:title=These rules exist because we broke them and paid the price.|borderColor=#FF0000}

h3. Rule 1: Jira Is the Only Place Work Exists

* All requests start as Jira tickets
* No execution based on Discord, email, or meetings alone
* Meeting outcomes logged in Jira
* *If it's not in Jira, it does not exist*

{note:title=We learned}Voice notes and scattered documents caused the factsheet disaster.{note}

----

h3. Rule 2: Silence Is NOT Approval

* Approval happens *explicitly* in Jira (comment or status change)
* No work starts because "I didn't get a reply"
* If approval is needed and not given → ticket is *Blocked*
* Approvers must say "Approved" or "Not Approved" — silence blocks

{note:title=We learned}Implicit approvals led to building the wrong things.{note}

----

h3. Rule 3: Work Does Not Start Without the Start Gate

Every ticket needs *ALL* of these before "In Progress":

|| Required || Description ||
| *Outcome* | "When this is done, we can ___" |
| *In Scope* | 2-5 bullets of what we WILL do |
| *Out of Scope* | Explicit exclusions |
| *Acceptance Criteria* | 3-7 testable conditions |
| *Owner* | Single person responsible |
| *Approvers* | Assigned AND have explicitly approved |
| *Dependencies* | Listed |
| *Example/Mock* | Screenshot, example data, expected output |

{warning:title=Missing ANY = ticket stays in "Ready for Clarification"}
The "6 weeks → 3 days" factsheet failure happened because work started without passing this gate.
{warning}

----

h3. Rule 4: One Developer, One Ticket (WIP = 1)

* Each developer works on *one ticket at a time*
* No parallel work (context switching kills productivity)
* Finish before pulling the next
* Exception: Only if blocked AND blocker takes >24h to resolve

{note:title=We learned}Part-time developers with multiple tickets never finish any of them.{note}

----

h3. Rule 5: Scope Changes Go Back

* Any change to scope mid-work → ticket goes back to "Ready for Clarification"
* This is not punishment; this is protection
* If scope is unclear → *stop and clarify before continuing*
* "Agility" means controlled change, not constant drift

----

h3. Rule 6: Uncertainty Is Escalated Same Day

* If a developer is unsure → escalate *the same workday*
* Uncertainty is not a personal failure
* *Silence is the failure*
* Ambiguity is never "worked around" – it is surfaced

{note:title=We learned}Devs absorbed ambiguity instead of escalating. Problems discovered weeks late.{note}

----

h3. Rule 7: 24 Hours Without Progress = Blocked

* No real progress in 24h → ticket moves to *Blocked*
* When blocked, must state:
** What is blocking
** Who must unblock
** What decision is needed
* PM acts immediately (same day)

{note:title=We learned}Blocked work was invisible for days/weeks.{note}

----

h3. Rule 8: Trading Tickets Require Dual Approval

For ANY ticket touching trading logic (TWR, NAV, exposure, signals, fees):

|| Role || Must Approve ||
| *Deneb (CTO)* | Technical correctness |
| *Olda (Quant)* | Financial/trading correctness |

*Both must explicitly approve BEFORE development starts.*

{note:title=We learned}Trading-related tickets shipped with bugs because only one person reviewed.{note}

----

h3. Rule 9: Developers Can (and Must) Refuse Unclear Work

* If requirements are garbage, say "I can't start until I have X, Y, Z"
* Do NOT "start anyway and figure it out"
* Create a *Spike* (2-6h investigation) if truly unclear
* The power to refuse is protection, not defiance

{note:title=We learned}Devs started unclear work, then blamed requirements. Both sides lost.{note}

----

h3. Rule 10: The CTO Is Not the Safety Net

* Deneb is for *architecture and technical direction*, not daily problem-solving
* First ask: "Can I solve this myself?"
* Second ask: "Can I find the answer in docs/code?"
* Third ask: "Ask the team"
* Last resort: "Ask Deneb"

{note:title=We learned}Devs defaulted to "ask Deneb" → CTO became bottleneck, devs stopped growing.{note}

h1. Part 2: Sprint Structure (Monthly Cadence)

h3. Why Monthly Sprints

|| Reason || Explanation ||
| *Part-time reality* | Weekly sprints impossible with fragmented availability |
| *Reduced overhead* | Fewer ceremonies = more development time |
| *Better predictability* | Longer planning horizon for business |
| *Buffer for life* | Day jobs, vacations, unexpected issues have room |

h3. Sprint Flow

{info:title=Use Draw.io to create this flowchart}
*Week 0 (Last Week of Previous Sprint)*
→ Business Alignment Meeting (Azara + Robuxio)
→ Backlog Refinement (mostly async)
→ Jira Preparation

*Week 1 (Sprint Start)*
→ Sprint Planning (Dev Team Only)
→ Development begins

*Weeks 2-3*
→ Daily async updates
→ Standups (flexible, not rigid)
→ Development continues

*Week 4*
→ Development wraps up
→ Sprint Review (with business)
→ Retrospective (dev team)
{info}

----

h1. Part 3: Ceremonies (Minimal, High Impact)

h3. 3.1 Business Alignment Meeting (Pre-Planning)

|| Attribute || Value ||
| *Purpose* | Align on priorities before technical planning |
| *Participants* | Azara + Pavel/Dries |
| *Frequency* | Once per month, before sprint planning |
| *Duration* | ~1 hour |
| *Language* | English |

*Outcome:*
* Prioritized list of business deliverables

* *NO technical discussion* – that happens in planning

----

h3. 3.2 Sprint Planning (Development Only)

|| Attribute || Value ||
| *Purpose* | Define what can realistically be delivered |
| *Participants* | Dev team only (Deneb, Leo, Jamolpe, Erro, Azara) |
| *Duration* | ~2 hours |
| *Business attends* | NO – input already consolidated |

*Agenda:*
# Presentation of prioritized deliverables (by Azara)
# Review of epics and tasks in Jira
# *Start Gate Check* for each candidate ticket
# Estimation and capacity check
# Commitment to sprint scope
# Define Sprint Goal

*Daily Update Format:*
{code}
Next step: [what I'm working on]
Blocker: [none / describe]
ETA Confidence: [High / Medium / Low]
{code}

*Sync Standups:* Only when needed (not forced daily). If everyone updates async, skip the meeting.

----

h3. 3.4 Backlog Refinement (Mostly Async)

|| Attribute || Value ||
| *Purpose* | Prepare upcoming work for efficient planning |
| *Who Does It* | Azara (with dev input when needed) |

----

h3. 3.5 Sprint Review (With Business)

|| Attribute || Value ||
| *Purpose* | Demonstrate completed work, collect feedback |
| *Participants* | Dev team + Pavel + Dries |
| *Duration* | 1-1.5 hours |
| *Rule* | If it can't be demoed, it's not "Done" |

*Format:*
* Live demos of completed work
* Review: delivered vs planned
* Business validation and feedback
* Identify what needs follow-up

----

h3. 3.6 Retrospective (Dev Team Only)

|| Attribute || Value ||
| *Purpose* | Improve team processes |
| *Participants* | Dev team only |
| *Duration* | 1 hour max |
| *Output* | 1-2 concrete improvement actions |

*Questions:*
# What caused blockers this sprint?
# What caused rework?
# What rule should we change?

{warning:title=We will NOT skip retros}
Past failure: "1.5 months without retro" meant problems compounded.

h1. Part 4: The Jira Workflow

h3. Status Flow Diagram

{info:title=Create this diagram in Draw.io or Gliffy}
*IDEA* → (PM Triage within 48h) → *DRAFT* → (Ready to formalize?) → *READY FOR CLARIFICATION* ⚠️ STOP ZONE → (All fields + approvals?) → *READY* → (Dev pulls) → *IN PROGRESS* ↔ *BLOCKED* → (Code complete?) → *IN REVIEW* → (AC met?) → *DONE*
{info}

----

h3. Status Definitions

h4. IDEA
* *Purpose:* Capture raw requests from any source
* *Who Creates:* Anyone
* *PM Action:* Triage within 48h (tag source, classify type, check duplicates)
* *Exit:* Accept → Draft, Reject → Closed

h4. DRAFT
* *Purpose:* Shape the problem (NOT solve it)
* *Contributors:* Dries (client), Olda (trading), Deneb (architecture)
* *NOT Allowed:* Development work
* *Exit:* Ready to formalize → Ready for Clarification

h4. READY FOR CLARIFICATION ⚠️

{warning:title=STOP ZONE – This is where the "6 weeks → 3 days" failure happened}
PM identifies what's missing, assigns who must clarify.
*Exit:* ALL mandatory fields complete AND ALL approvers explicitly approved → Ready
{warning}

h4. READY (Start Gate Passed)
* *Purpose:* Ticket is STARTABLE
* *Requirements:* All 8 Start Gate items checked off
* *Exit:* Dev pulls ticket → In Progress

h4. IN PROGRESS
* *Purpose:* Active development
* *Rules:* WIP = 1 per dev
* *Before Starting:* Dev posts plan + assumptions
* *Exit:* Code complete → In Review

h4. BLOCKED
* *Triggered By:* No progress in 24h, missing decision, dependency unresolved
* *Required:* What's blocking, who must unblock, what decision needed
* *PM Action:* Act immediately (same day)

h4. IN REVIEW
* *Purpose:* Validate against acceptance criteria
* *Reviewers:* Trading → Olda, Technical → Deneb, Client → Dries
* *Exit:* All criteria verified → Done

h4. DONE
* *Criteria:* ALL acceptance criteria met
* *NOT "almost done"* – it works or it doesn't

# For trading tickets, *BOTH Deneb AND Olda must approve*
# Approvals are visible in ticket history (audit trail)

----

h1. Part 6: Business → Development Communication

h3. Dedicated Discord Channel

*Rules:*

----

h1. Part 8: Definition of Done (DoD)

A ticket is Done *ONLY IF*:

* (/) All acceptance criteria are met (verified, not assumed)
* (/) Code is merged to develop branch (if applicable)
* (/) Tested (unit tests, manual testing as appropriate)

h1. Part 9: Escalation Protocol

h3. When to Escalate

|| Situation || Escalate To || Timeline ||
| Technical decision needed | Deneb | Same day |
| Trading logic unclear | Olda | Same day |
| Client impact unclear | Dries | Same day |
| Strategic/priority conflict | Pavel | Within 24h |
| Dev blocked >24h | PM (Azara) → appropriate owner | Immediately |

h3. How to Escalate

# Add comment: what's needed, who's needed, deadline
# Tag person in Discord with \[BLOCKER\] prefix
# Follow up same day

h3. Urgency Tags

|| Tag || Meaning || Expected Response ||
| \[BLOCKER\] | Work stopped | Immediate |
| \[NEEDS-DECISION\] | Waiting on choice | Same day |
| \[ASYNC\] | Not urgent | Within 24h |

h1. Part 11: Priority Conflict Resolution

|| Conflict || Who Wins ||
| CEO vs Anyone | CEO (business decision) |
| CTO vs PM | CTO on technical, PM on timing |
| Quant vs COO | Each owns their domain |
| Multiple P0s | Escalate to Pavel |

*All priority decisions documented in Jira. No verbal overrides.*

----

h1. Part 12: PM-Light Effort Estimation

Azara's monthly PM effort (separate from development):

|| Activity || Frequency || Duration || Monthly Hours ||
| Business alignment meeting | 1/month | 1h | 1h |
| Backlog refinement | 1/month | 1.5h | 1.5h |
| Sprint planning facilitation | 1/month | 2h | 2h |
| Sprint review | 1/month | 1.5h | 1.5h |
| Retrospective | 1/month | 1h | 1h |
| Jira maintenance & async coordination | Ongoing | ~20 min/day | ~7h |
| Start Gate reviews (ad-hoc) | As needed | ~2h total | 2h |
| *Total* | | | *~16 hours/month* |

----

h1. Part 13: What We Track (Metrics)

h3. Weekly Metrics (PM Responsibility)

|| Metric || What It Measures || Goal ||
| *Cycle Time* | Ready → Done | Trend down |
| *Time in Blocked* | Where work gets stuck | Minimize |
| *Time in Clarification* | How long clarity takes | Minimize |
| *Rework Rate* | Tickets moved back after start | < 10% |
| *Start Gate Pass Rate* | Tickets ready at planning | > 80% |

h3. What We Do NOT Track

* (x) Hours worked
* (x) Personal velocity
* (x) "Busyness" indicators
* (x) Lines of code

{info:title=Measure flow, not fear.}{info}

----

h1. Part 14: Working Agreements

h3. For Developers

# *Post daily updates* (Jira or Discord) – even if "no change"
# *Refuse unclear work* – ask for Spike if needed
# *Escalate same day* – don't absorb ambiguity
# *One ticket at a time* – finish before pulling next
# *Ask team before asking CTO* – build collective knowledge

h3. For Business (Pavel, Dries)

# *Submit requests through proper channels* – Discord format or Jira
# *Provide written requirements* – no voice notes as primary source
# *Approve explicitly* – silence blocks work
# *Attend Sprint Review* – validate delivered work
# *Respect sprint boundaries* – changes are expensive

h3. For PM (Azara)

# *Triage within 48h* – nothing lingers in Idea
# *Enforce Start Gate* – no exceptions for "just this once"
# *Act on blockers same day* – visibility is your job
# *Protect the sprint* – push back on mid-sprint scope changes
# *When wearing dev hat* – your tickets follow same rules

h3. For CTO (Deneb)

# *Approve tickets explicitly* – silence is not approval
# *Approve or reject quickly* – don't be the bottleneck
# *Step back from daily decisions* – trust the process and team
# *Review Azara's tickets* – conflict of interest coverage
# *Focus on architecture* – that's your unique value

----

h1. Part 15: Conflict of Interest Protocol

Since Azara is both PM and Developer:

|| Situation || Who Handles ||
| Azara's tickets need Start Gate review | Deneb reviews |
| Azara's work needs approval | Normal approvers (Deneb/Olda/Dries) |
| PM decision affects Azara's workload | Deneb has veto |
| Sprint capacity planning | Azara declares his dev hours, team validates |

*Transparency Rule:* Any potential conflict is flagged in Jira comments.

h1. Part 17: Quick Reference Card

h3. The 10 Rules (Summary)

# *Jira is truth* – if not in Jira, doesn't exist
# *Silence ≠ Approval* – explicit approval required
# *Start Gate or no start* – all 8 items checked
# *WIP = 1* – one ticket per dev
# *Scope change = go back* – no silent drift
# *Escalate same day* – uncertainty isn't absorbed
# *24h = Blocked* – make stuck work visible
# *Trading = dual approval* – Deneb + Olda
# *Devs can refuse* – unclear work doesn't start
# *CTO ≠ safety net* – team solves, CTO guides

h3. Approval Quick Reference

|| Type || Approvers ||
| Core Trading | Deneb + Olda |
| Trading-Related | Deneb + Olda |
| Client/UX | Deneb + Dries |
| Infra | Deneb |

h3. When in Doubt

# Unclear → Create Spike (2-6h max)
# Blocked → Move to Blocked, escalate same day
# Scope changed → Back to Ready for Clarification
# No response → Ticket is blocked, tag PM

----

h1. Part 18: Success Criteria

h3. You Know This Is Working When:

|| Signal || Meaning ||
| No ticket starts without Start Gate | Clarity before execution (/) |
| Blocked tickets caught within 24h | Early detection works (/) |
| Rework rate < 10% | Scope is clear upfront (/) |
| Cycle time trending down | Flow is improving (/) |
| No "6 weeks → 3 days" surprises | System prevents waste (/) |
| Devs solving without CTO | Team is growing (/) |
| Retros happen every sprint | Continuous improvement (/) |

h3. Warning Signs It's Failing:

|| Signal || Action ||
| "Deneb will know" becomes common | Retro: reinforce Rule 10 |
| Tickets starting without approval | PM blocks and resets |
| Same problems recurring | Retro: find root cause |
| Standups/retros skipped | PM enforces, escalates if needed |
| Deadlines always slip | Review estimation process |

|| Version || Date || Author || Changes ||
| 1.0 | Dec 2024 | Hakan (PM) | Initial framework |
| 2.0 | Jan 2026 | Azara (Interim PM) | Merged pragmatic Scrum approach, acknowledged part-time reality, added lessons learned, monthly cadence |
