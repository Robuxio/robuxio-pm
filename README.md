# Robuxio PM Framework

This repository contains the official PM framework for Robuxio.

## Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [ROBUXIO_PM_BIBLE.md](ROBUXIO_PM_BIBLE.md) | The rules - How work is managed at Robuxio |

## Quick Start

## Living Documents

> **These documents are living artifacts that evolve with the team.**

Both the PM Bible and Lifecycle Flows are **continuously iterated** following our Agile framework:

- **After each Retrospective:** Review what's working and what isn't
- **Incorporate feedback:** Team members can propose changes via PR
- **Update the docs:** Improvements are merged and versioned
- **Communicate changes:** Team is notified of updates

### How to Propose Changes

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make your edits to the relevant `.md` file
3. Open a Pull Request with:
   - What you're changing
   - Why (link to retro action item if applicable)
4. Get review from PM + one other team member
5. Merge when approved

### Versioning

We track major changes in each document's "Document History" section. After significant updates:
- Bump the version number
- Add entry to history table
- Note what changed and why

## The 10 Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Jira is truth** – if not in Jira, doesn't exist
2. **Silence ≠ Approval** – explicit approval required
3. **Start Gate or no start** – all items checked before work begins
4. **WIP = 1** – one ticket per dev
5. **Scope change = go back** – no silent drift
6. **Escalate same day** – uncertainty isn't absorbed
7. **24h = Blocked** – make stuck work visible
8. **Trading = dual approval** – Deneb + Olda
9. **Devs can refuse** – unclear work doesn't start
10. **CTO ≠ safety net** – team solves, CTO guides

*These frameworks exist because we learned from our mistakes. We continue to improve them.*
