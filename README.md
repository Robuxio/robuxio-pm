# Robuxio PM Framework

This repository contains the official PM framework for Robuxio.

## Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [ROBUXIO_PM_BIBLE.md](ROBUXIO_PM_BIBLE.md) | The rules - How work is managed at Robuxio |
| [ROBUXIO_LIFECYCLE_FLOWS.md](ROBUXIO_LIFECYCLE_FLOWS.md) | The flows - Complete lifecycle of Epics, Stories, Spikes, Bugs |
| [ROBUXIO_PM_BIBLE_CONFLUENCE.txt](ROBUXIO_PM_BIBLE_CONFLUENCE.txt) | Confluence-formatted version of the PM Bible |

## Quick Start

1. **New to Robuxio?** Start with the [PM Bible](ROBUXIO_PM_BIBLE.md)
2. **Need to understand the flow?** See [Lifecycle Flows](ROBUXIO_LIFECYCLE_FLOWS.md)
3. **Publishing to Confluence?** Use the [Confluence version](ROBUXIO_PM_BIBLE_CONFLUENCE.txt)

## The 10 Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Jira is truth** – if not in Jira, doesn't exist
2. **Silence ≠ Approval** – explicit approval required
3. **Start Gate or no start** – all items checked before work begins
4. **WIP = 1** – one ticket per dev
5. **Scope change = go back** – no silent drift
6. **Escalate same day** – uncertainty isn't absorbed
7. **24h = Blocked** – make stuck work visible
8. **Trading = dual approval** – Deneb + Olda
9. **Devs can refuse** – unclear work doesn't start
10. **CTO ≠ safety net** – team solves, CTO guides

## Current Team

| Role | Person |
|------|--------|
| CEO | Pavel |
